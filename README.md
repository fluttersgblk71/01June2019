Helping you learn new language, one amigo at a time.

# Challenges faced learning new language
- Lacks human creativity
- Words not translated properly
- Lack of motivation
- Absense of native speaker to practise


# Our solution
- A Mobile/Desktop app which connects person 1 - fluent in language A and would like to learn language B, with person 2 - fluent in language B and would like to learn language A.
-Language translation to create flash cards for offline use
